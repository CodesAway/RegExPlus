/**
 * The result of a match operation.
 * 
 * <p>This interface is an extension of Java's {@link MatchResult} class.
 * Javadocs were copied and appended with the added functionality.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This interface contains query methods used to determine the
 * results of a match against a regular expression. The match boundaries,
 * groups and group boundaries can be seen but not modified through
 * a <code>MatchResult</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <br />
 * 
 * <p>Starting with Version 0.2, <code>MatchResult</code> extends
 * <code>Iterable&lt;MatchResult&gt;</code> and is Groovified,
 * adding some useful functionality.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Given the following MatchResult:</p>
 * 
 * <pre><code> Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("(a)(b)(c)(d)");
 * Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("abcd");
 * matcher.find();
 * 
 * MatchResult result = matcher.toMatchResult();</code></pre>
 * 
 * <p>Loop through each group (by group number):</p>
 * 
 * <pre><code>&nbsp; <span style='color: green'
 * >// Loops for group = 1 to 3 (group count)</span>
 * &nbsp; for (int group : result.keySet()) {
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style='color: green'>/*
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; * Output:
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; *
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; * result[1] = a
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; * result[2] = b
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; * result[3] = c
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; *<!---->/</span>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; System.out.printf("result[%d] = %s%n", group, <span
 * >result.group(group));</span>
 * &nbsp; }</code></pre>
 * 
 * <p>Loop through each group's value:</p>
 * 
 * <pre><code>&nbsp; <span style='color: green'
 * >// Loops for each value</span>
 * &nbsp; for (String groupValue : result.values()) {
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style='color: green'>/*
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; * Output:
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; *
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; * Value = a
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; * Value = b
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; * Value = c
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; *<!---->/</span>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; System.out.printf("Value = %s%n", groupValue);
